<h1>Welcome to rsyslog</h1>
<p><b><a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/">Rsyslog</a>
is an enhanced syslogd suitable both for small systems as
well as large enterprises.</b>
<p>This page provide a few quick pointers which hopefully make your
experience with rsyslog a pleasant one. These are:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="manual.html">rsyslog manual</a> - this points to locally
installed documentation which exactly matches the version you have installed.
It is highly suggested to at least briefly look over these files.
<li>The <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com">rsyslog web site</a>, which offers
information for different versions of rsyslog.
<li>The <a href="troubleshoot.html">troubleshooting guide</a> hopefully helps if
things do not immediately work out.
</ul>
<p>In general, rsyslog supports plain old syslog.conf format, except that the
config file is now called rsyslog.conf. This should help you get started
quickly.</p>
<pa>
The man pages offer a bare minimum of information (and are still quite long). Read the 
built-in <a href="manual.html">html documentation</a> instead.
When you change the configuration, remember to restart rsyslogd, because otherwise
it will not use your new settings.</p>
<p>The built-in <a href="history.html">rsyslog history</a>
page is for you if you would like to learn a little more
on why there is an rsyslog at all. If you are interested why you should
care about rsyslog at all, you may want to read Rainer's essay on "<a href="http://rgerhards.blogspot.com/2007/08/why-does-world-need-another-syslogd.html">why
the world needs another syslogd</a>".</p>
