<h1>IP Address Anonimization Module (mmanon)</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mmanon</b></p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards &lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Available since</b>: 7.3.7</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>The mmanon module permits to anonymize IP addresses. It is a message 
modification module that actually changes the IP address inside the message,
so after calling mmanon, the original message can no longer be obtained.
Note that anonymization will break digital signatures on the message, if
they exist.
<p><i>How are IP-Addresses defined?</i>
<p>We assume that an IP address consists of four octets in dotted notation,
where each of the octets has a value between 0 and 255, inclusively.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Module Configuration Parameters</b>:</p>
<p>Currently none.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Action Confguration Parameters</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>mode</b> - default "rewrite"<br>
There exists the "simple" and "rewrite" mode. In simple mode, only octets
as whole can be anonymized and the length of the message is never changed.
This means that when the last three octets of the address 10.1.12.123 are
anonymized, the result will be 10.0.00.000. This means that the length of the
original octets is still visible and may be used to draw some privacy-evasive
conclusions. This mode is slightly faster than "overwrite" mode, and this
may matter in high throughput environments.<br>
The default "rewrite" mode will do full anonymization of any number of bits
and it will also normlize the address, so that no information about the
original IP address is available. So in the above example, 10.1.12.123 would
be anonymized to 10.0.0.0.
<li><b>ipv4.bits</b> - default 16<br>
This set the number of bits that should be anonymized (bits are from the
right, so lower bits are anonymized first). This setting permits to save
network information while still anonymizing user-specific data. The more
bits you discard, the better the anonymization obviously is. The default
of 16 bits reflects what German data privacy rules consider as being
sufficinetly anonymized. We assume, this can also be used as a rough
but conservative guideline for other countries.<br>
Note: when in simple mode, only bits on a byte boundary can be specified.
As such, any value other than 8, 16, 24 or 32 is invalid. If an invalid
value is given, it is rounded to the next byte boundary (so we favor stronger
anonymization in that case). For example, a bit value of 12 will become 16 in
simple mode (an error message is also emitted).
<li><b>replacementChar</b> - default "x"<br>
In simple mode, this sets the character
that the to-be-anonymized part of the IP address is to be overwritten
with. In rewrite mode, this parameter is <b>not permitted</b>, as in
this case we need not necessarily rewrite full octets. As such, the anonymized
part is always zero-filled and replacementChar is of no use. If it is
specified, an error message is emitted and the parameter ignored.
</ul>

<p><b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>only IPv4</b> is supported
</ul>

<p><b>Samples:</b></p>
<p>In this snippet, we write one file without anonymization and another one
with the message anonymized. Note that once mmanon has run, access to the 
original message is no longer possible (execept if stored in user
variables before anonymization).
<p><textarea rows="5" cols="60">module(load="mmanon")
action(type="omfile" file="/path/to/non-anon.log")
action(type="mmanon")
action(type="omfile" file="/path/to/anon.log")
</textarea>

<p>This next snippet is almost identical to the first one, but
here we anonymize the full IPv4 address. Note that by
modifying the number of bits, you can anonymize different parts
of the address. Keep in mind that in simple mode (used here), the bit values
must match IP address bytes, so for IPv4 only the values 8, 16, 24 and
32 are valid. Also, in this example the replacement is done
via asterisks instead of lower-case "x"-letters. Also keep in mind that
"replacementChar" can only be set in simple mode.
<p><textarea rows="5" cols="60">module(load="mmanon")
action(type="omfile" file="/path/to/non-anon.log")
action(type="mmanon" ipv4.bits="32" mode="simple" replacementChar="*")
action(type="omfile" file="/path/to/anon.log")
</textarea>

<p>The next snippet is also based on the first one, but anonimzes an
"odd" number of bits, 12. The value of 12 is used by some folks as a
compromise between keeping privacy and still permiting to gain some
more in-depth insight from log files. Note that anonymizing 12 bits
may be insufficient to fulfill legal requirements (if such exist).
