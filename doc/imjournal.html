<h1>Systemd Journal Input Module</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imjournal</b></p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Milan Bartos
&lt;mbartos@redhat.com&gt; (This module is not project-supported)</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>Provides the ability to import structured log messages from systemd journal
to syslog.</p>
<p>Note that this module reads the journal database, what is considered a
relativly performance-intense operation. As such, the performance of a 
configuration utilizing this
module may be notably slower then when using
<a href="imuxsock.html">imuxsock</a>. The journal provides imuxsock with a
copy of all "classical" syslog messages, however, it does not provide
structured data. If the latter is needed, imjournal must be used. Otherwise,
imjournal may be simply replaced by imuxsock.
<p>We suggest to check out our short presentation on
<a href="http://youtu.be/GTS7EuSdFKE">rsyslog journal integration</a> to
learn more details of anticipated use cases.

<p><b>Warning:</b> Some versions of systemd journal have problems with database
corruption, which leads to the journal to return the same data endlessly
in a thight loop. This results in massive message duplication inside rsyslog
probably resulting in a denial-of-service when the system ressouces get
exhausted. This can be somewhat mitigated by using proper rate-limiters, but
even then there are spikes of old data which are endlessly repeated. By default,
ratelimiting is activated and permits to process 20,000 messages within 10
minutes, what should be well enough for most use cases. If insufficient, use
the parameters described below to adjust the permitted volume.
<b>It is strongly recommended to use this plugin only if there
is hard need to do so.</b>

<p><b>Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<p><b>Module Directives</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>PersistStateInterval</b> number-of-messages<br>
This is a global setting. It specifies how often should the journal state be persisted.
The persists happens after each <i>number-of-messages</i>.
This option is useful for rsyslog to start reding from the last journal message it read.

<li><b>StateFile</b> /path/to/file<br>
This is a global setting. It specifies where the state file for persisting
journal state is located.

<li><b>ratelimit.interval</b> seconds (default: 600)<br>
Specifies the interval in seconds onto which rate-limiting is to be applied.
If more than ratelimit.burst messages are read during that interval, further
messages up to the end of the interval are discarded. The number of messages
discarded is emitted at the end of the interval (if there were any discards).
<br>Setting this to value zero turns off ratelimiting. Note that it is
<b>not recommended to turn of ratelimiting</b>, except that you know for
sure journal database entries will never be corrupted. Without ratelimiting,
a corrupted systemd journal database may cause a kind of denial of service (we
are stressing this point as multiple users have reported us such problems
with the journal database - information current as of June 2013).

<li><b>ratelimit.burst</b> messages (default: 20000)<br>
Specifies the maximum number of messages that can be emitted within the
ratelimit.interval interval. For futher information, see description there.

<li><b>IgnorePreviousMessages</b> [<b>off</b>/on]<br>
This option specifies whether imjournal should ignore messages currently in
journal and read only new messages. This option is only used when there is
no StateFile to avoid message loss.
</ul>

<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>As stated above, a corrupted systemd journal database can cause major
problems, depending on what the corruption results in. This is beyond the
control of the rsyslog team.
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>
The following example shows pulling structured imjournal messages and saving them into /var/log/ceelog.
